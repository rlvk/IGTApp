# IGTApp
3rd part libraries included :
1. Volley networking library - The reason is to avoid reinventing the wheel 
and putting boilerplate code inside networking class. Volley works nice with Gson (explained below) and 
provides very handy features like prioritization, cancelling requests and automatic memory caching (if needed). 
It's also easy for customization.
2. Gson library - Added purely for Java serialization/deserialization used in API JSON object parsing.
